> **Note**: This README is a perfect example of how to turn "I made a simple audio gauge" into "I BUILT A REVOLUTIONARY SILENCE MONITORING SYSTEM!" The power of technical writing at its finest - where every basic feature sounds like it could solve world hunger. Please read with a grain of salt and enjoy our enthusiasm! ðŸ˜„

# Silence Monitor

A web-based tool that visualizes silence duration using multiple audio gauges. Perfect for monitoring awkward silence in conversations, interviews, or any scenario where audio engagement needs to be tracked.

## Overview

This project was built entirely through prompts with Claude (Anthropic's AI assistant). It uses browser's audio API to detect sound levels and displays the duration of silence using professional gauge visualizations.

## Features

- Multiple sensitivity levels to accommodate different environments
- Real-time audio monitoring
- Visual color-coded feedback (green to red)
- Progressive status messages indicating silence duration
- No installation required - runs directly in browser
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices

## How It Works

The application:
1. Requests microphone access from the browser
2. Continuously monitors audio levels
3. Updates gauges in real-time based on sound detection
4. Shows different messages based on silence duration
5. Uses color gradients to indicate silence severity:
   - Green (0-2s): Normal conversation
   - Light Green (2-4s): Brief pause
   - Yellow (4-6s): Notable silence
   - Orange (6-8s): Extended silence
   - Red (8-10s): Maximum awkwardness

## Technical Details

- Built using:
  - React
  - Gauge.js for visualizations
  - Web Audio API for sound detection
  - Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- No build process required
- No external dependencies to install

## Usage

1. Download the HTML file
2. Open it in a modern web browser
3. Allow microphone access when prompted
4. Watch the gauges respond to silence in real-time

## Configuration

The application includes three gauges with different sensitivity levels:
- High Sensitivity (2): Detects even slight drops in audio
- Medium Sensitivity (5): Balanced detection
- Low Sensitivity (10): Only responds to complete silence

## Customization

You can easily customize:
- Sensitivity levels
- Status messages
- Color schemes
- Number of gauges
- Gauge sizes
- Update frequencies

## Development

This project was developed through an iterative conversation with Claude. The development process included:
1. Initial concept and basic implementation
2. Addition of multiple sensitivity levels
3. Integration of professional gauge visualization
4. Refinement of user interface and messages
5. Performance optimization

## Note About Prompts

This entire project was built through conversation with Claude. The prompts focused on:
1. Initial concept development
2. Technical implementation details
3. User interface design
4. Visual feedback mechanisms
5. Status message crafting
6. Performance optimization
7. Documentation

The iterative nature of the conversation allowed for continuous refinement and improvement of the implementation.
